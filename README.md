The Theory of Primordial Harmony (TPH) proposes a novel framework for understanding systemic coherence across scales—from subatomic particles to ecosystems and human institutions. It is based on the relationship between two universal forces: **quantum entanglement (QE)**, representing deep relational coherence, and **entropy (S)**, representing systemic disorder. Rather than being driven by force or matter alone, harmony arises when connection outweighs disintegration, and relational unity overcomes contextual fragmentation.

In this model, harmony increases when meaningful connections (QE) rise and disorder (S) remains low. The logic is straightforward but powerful: **connection must overcome entropy for harmony to emerge**. Thus, H quantifies the resilience of coherence in the face of complexity.

This framework aligns with the arc of cosmic evolution: the universe began in a state of extreme entropy and fragmentation (the Big Bang), and over time, structure and coherence emerged—from atoms to galaxies, molecules to life, and from life to conscious, adaptive minds. \[9] Life itself resists entropy by generating local coherence through replication, adaptation, and interdependence. Evolution can be seen as the progressive refinement of relational coherence across time. \[5]

TPH reflects this universal movement—from chaos to complexity, from fragmentation to integration—suggesting that harmony is not static, but an emergent property of systems that cultivate resilient connections amidst disorder. \[6]

This mathematical simplicity hides a profound intuition: **harmony results from meaningful connection in the midst of entropic complexity**. \[1]

## Theoretical Foundation

At the core of the Theory of Primordial Harmony is the idea that **reality is made of relationships**, not merely objects. **Quantum entanglement (QE)**, a phenomenon where particles behave as a unified system across distance, is reinterpreted as a **symbol of relational coherence** observable across all domains \[8]. **Entropy (S)** reflects the natural tendency toward disorganization, noise, disintegration, or excess unchanneled possibility \[2].

The harmony equation is expressed as:

$$
H = \frac{QE}{1 + S}
$$

where:

* **QE** ∈ \[0, 1] — degree of deep coherence
* **S** ≥ 0 — level of contextual disorder
* **H** ∈ \[0, 1] — resulting harmony

This formulation bridges two foundational domains of physics: the **quantum** and the **classical**. Quantum entanglement represents one of the most non-classical, non-local phenomena, indicating that particles can remain instantaneously connected regardless of distance \[3]. In contrast, entropy is a thermodynamic measure deeply rooted in classical physics, capturing the probabilistic behavior and disintegration of macroscopic systems over time \[4].

By placing QE and S in a single equation, TPH establishes a conceptual bridge where **quantum relationality** and **classical disorder** are seen not as separate paradigms, but as complementary forces shaping coherence at all scales. It proposes that systems—whether atomic, biological, or social—persist and evolve not solely by resisting entropy, but by cultivating entangled, coherent relations that counterbalance disorder.

In this view, harmony (H) is not merely a metaphor, but a unifying variable that translates micro-level quantum integrity into macro-level systemic sustainability. At the quantum level, coherence allows particles to maintain instant correlations regardless of distance. At the macro level, harmony reflects a system's ability to integrate diverse components—biological, social, or ecological—into a stable and adaptive whole. H thus functions as a bridge variable: it expresses how subtle relational coherence at the smallest scales can ripple outward, influencing the stability and sustainability of large-scale systems. This allows us to conceptualize harmony not as static perfection, but as a dynamic equilibrium between the entropic forces of dispersion and the connective forces of entanglement. The result is a cross-scale logic of organization, revealing how the quantum nature of connection and the classical nature of decay interact to shape the evolution of complexity. \[7]

This proposal is inspired by parallels between quantum entanglement and the functional connectivity of adaptive systems. It does not assume that macroscopic processes literally share the properties of quantum phenomena, but rather that there is epistemological value in applying this metaphor of interdependent coherence.

> Note: A generalized version of the harmony equation includes sensitivity exponents (γ, δ), allowing more flexible modeling across systems. In this paper, we assume γ = δ = 1 for simplicity, but future work expands on this foundation.
