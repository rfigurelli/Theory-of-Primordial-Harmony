## Abstract

The Theory of Primordial Harmony (TPH) proposes a novel framework for understanding systemic coherence across scales—from subatomic particles to ecosystems and human institutions. It is based on the relationship between two universal forces: **quantum entanglement (QE)**, representing deep relational coherence, and **entropy (S)**, representing systemic disorder. Rather than being driven by force or matter alone, harmony arises when connection outweighs disintegration, and relational unity overcomes contextual fragmentation.

In this model, harmony increases when meaningful connections (QE) rise and disorder (S) remains low. The logic is straightforward but powerful: **connection must overcome entropy for harmony to emerge**. Thus, H quantifies the resilience of coherence in the face of complexity.

This framework aligns with the arc of cosmic evolution: the universe began in a state of extreme entropy and fragmentation (the Big Bang), and over time, structure and coherence emerged—from atoms to galaxies, molecules to life, and from life to conscious, adaptive minds. \[9] Life itself resists entropy by generating local coherence through replication, adaptation, and interdependence. Evolution can be seen as the progressive refinement of relational coherence across time. \[5]

TPH reflects this universal movement—from chaos to complexity, from fragmentation to integration—suggesting that harmony is not static, but an emergent property of systems that cultivate resilient connections amidst disorder. \[6]

This mathematical simplicity hides a profound intuition: **harmony results from meaningful connection in the midst of entropic complexity**. \[1]
